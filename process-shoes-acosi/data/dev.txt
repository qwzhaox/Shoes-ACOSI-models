Liked the look of the shoe , so I purchased it online . It ' s a comfortable , good looking shoe . Probably ok for a run , but will end up wearing it for casual use . NB runs a little small .

These fit great , nice style , very comfortable , but not meant for constant walking . Within 3 months I wore a hole through the top of shoe . I would buy again for style , but not constant walking .
