They were a gift to my wife . Most comfortable shoes she's had and she loves the look . On the negative , the adidas white band above the sole cracked after wearing it 3 times . Both shoes have multiple cracks in the front now . Makes me regret paying so much for such poor quality materials .####[['implicit', 'contextofuse purchase_context', 'neutral', 'a gift to my wife', 'direct'], ['shoes', 'performance comfort', 'positive', 'most comfortable', 'direct'], ['shoes', 'appearance form', 'positive', 'she loves the look', 'direct'], ['the adidas white band above the sole', 'performance durability', 'negative', 'cracked after wearing it 3 times .', 'direct'], ['the adidas white band above the sole', 'appearance shoe component', 'negative', 'cracked after wearing it 3 times .', 'direct'], ['both shoes', 'appearance shoe component', 'negative', 'have multiple cracks', 'direct'], ['implicit', 'cost_value', 'negative', 'makes me regret paying so much for such poor quality materials', 'direct'], ['materials', 'appearance material', 'negative', 'makes me regret paying so much for such poor quality materials', 'direct']]

I really wanted to have some white adidas , however , these shoes fit better on those that have larger ankles .
