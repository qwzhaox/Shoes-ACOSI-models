Reebok is a go-to brand for me because their shoes often fit my wide feet well in a way other brands don't . However, this shoe is a lot narrower than Reebok's other offerings, so I wouldn't recommend it if you have wide feet . But it is a very cute shoe so I recommend it otherwise !",

Overall I would buy again",

As others have commented the 940 does run wide &amp; tends to slip on heel . I eliminated this problem using a thicker sock . Otherwise the 940 is a comfortable shoe for me .",
