As someone with a kind of wide foot , I really wanted this shoe to fit because I love the look ! Reebok is a go-to brand for me because their shoes often fit my wide feet well in a way other brands don't .

The shoe fit well and was sturdily constructed . It comes with 2 pairs of laces ; black and white . That's a nice touch for changing up the look . The insole , however , is sort of cloth-covered . I would use them for treadmill walking and prefer a poly / foam-covered insole for long-term comfort and perspiration / stain resistance .

I love the way the shoes look and they feel great on the bottom of my feet however they are really narrow and not very comfortable around the middle / upper part of my feet .

These are definitely going to be some of my most worn shoes of the spring and summer . They're so cute and go with so much .
