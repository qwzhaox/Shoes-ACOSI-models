I love this shoe . As someone with wide feet it is frustrating trying to find quality shoes to play in . New Balance has done it once again with the TWO WXY . The shoe is comfortable , has good grip and is responsive with good cushioning and support . I would highly recommend to others . I did have to go up 1 / 2 size , but that is totally fine with me !####[['shoe', 'general', 'positive', 'i love', 'indirect'], ['shoes', 'performance use case applicability', 'positive', 'as someone with wide feet it is frustrating trying to find quality shoes to play in', 'indirect'], ['two wxy', 'general', 'positive', 'has done it once again with the two wxy', 'indirect'], ['shoe', 'performance comfort', 'positive', 'comfortable', 'direct'], ['shoe', 'performance support_stability', 'positive', 'responsive with good cushioning and support', 'direct'], ['implicit', 'cost_value', 'positive', 'i would highly recommend to others', 'direct'], ['implicit', 'performance sizing_fit', 'neutral', 'i did have to go up 1 _ 2 size , but that is totally fine with me', 'indirect']]
In terms of the design and material that was used makes the shoe look pretty good ! It's just that the people who have any sort of wide foot the shoe would be very uncomfortable . It felt like my foot was constantly being squeezed . Maybe a half size could help but I wouldn't recommend experimenting with that .####[['shoe', 'appearance material', 'positive', 'design and material that was used makes the shoe look pretty good', 'direct'], ['shoe', 'appearance misc', 'positive', 'design and material that was used makes the shoe look pretty good', 'direct'], ['shoe', 'performance comfort', 'negative', 'any sort of wide foot the shoe would be very uncomfortable', 'direct'], ['shoe', 'appearance form', 'negative', 'any sort of wide foot the shoe would be very uncomfortable', 'direct'], ['implicit', 'performance sizing_fit', 'negative', 'felt like my foot was constantly being squeezed', 'direct'], ['implicit', 'cost_value', 'negative', "i wouldn't recommend", 'direct']]

Great looking shoe in person .
