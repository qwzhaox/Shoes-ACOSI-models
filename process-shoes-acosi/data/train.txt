I purchased this shoe style a couple of years ago . I order a replacement pair in 2021 and noticed that they are considerably narrower than the previous pair that I own . I used the tape measure to measure both and compare . Hopefully , they will make their upcoming version wider , because my previous pair was awesome .####[]

I have several pairs of NewBalance shoes which all fit well and are very comfortable . I have only worn these NM306RST twice and the left is very tight in the toe box and created a blister between two toes . I can no longer ware the shoes . Hopefully NewBalance will help and has a solution .####[['newbalance shoes', 'contextofuse use case', 'positive', 'i have several pairs of newbalance shoes which all fit well and are very comfortable .', 'indirect'], ['nm306rst', 'contextofuse review_temporality', 'negative', 'i have only worn these nm306rst twice', 'indirect'], ['nm306rst', 'performance sizing_fit', 'negative', 'left is very tight in the toe box', 'indirect'], ['toe box', 'appearance shoe component', 'negative', 'left is very tight in the toe box', 'indirect'], ['nm306rst', 'performance comfort', 'negative', 'created a blister between two toes', 'indirect'], ['shoes', 'performance general', 'negative', 'i can no longer ware the shoes', 'indirect'], ['newbalance', 'contextofuse purchase_context', 'neutral', 'hopefully newbalance will help and has a solution', 'indirect']]
It took 7 days for it to finally ship . I requested updates at 3 and then 7 days and got no responses , other than , I think it will ship out today on day 3 . Shoes fit tighter than other NB I've had in the past so I returned . Money wasn't in my account 3 days after tracking shows it was received by returns department . Love New Balance shoes but trying other brands because of the experience .####[['implicit', 'contextofuse purchase_context', 'neutral', 'it took 7 days for it to finally ship', 'indirect'], ['implicit', 'contextofuse purchase_context', 'negative', 'i requested updates at 3 and then 7 days and got no responses , other than , i think it will ship out today on day 3', 'direct'], ['shoes', 'performance sizing_fit', 'negative', "fit tighter than other nb i've had in the past", 'indirect'], ['shoes', 'cost_value', 'negative', 'so i returned', 'direct'], ['implicit', 'contextofuse purchase_context', 'negative', "money wasn't in my account 3 days after tracking shows it was received by returns department", 'indirect'], ['new balance shoes', 'cost_value', 'negative', 'love new balance shoes but trying other brands because of the experience', 'indirect']]
