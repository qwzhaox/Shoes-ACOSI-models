Liked the shoes . I left them outside and the next day they had shrunk by about 3 full sizes . I assume it was from the heat from the sun . Went from a men ' s size 10 to comfortable fitting someone who wears a women ' s 8 . I ' ve left many other pairs outside before and none of them have shrunk at all .
