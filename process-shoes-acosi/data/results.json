Also , the soles must have been made in different factories or something because the soles sizes were different . The right shoe had a wider sole that stuck out more than the left , so the right shoe was at least 1/2\" wider than the left . Poorly made and wish I saw it before I wore it .",

The foam in them is hard/thin , the shoe itself just looks cheaply made . The grip on the bottom isn't there . I was looking for a light weight , cushioned and nice runners tread . If you are looking for a reliable running shoe keep looking !",

Shoe was light weight and comfortable but I definitely like the FuelCell Propel v2 better .",

This is not my imagination , I've compared shoes . I went to place an order and 12 . 5 is no longer an option . Make Reebok sizing great again !",
