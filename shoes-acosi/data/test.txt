They're exactly what I had hoped for, fun colors and a nice fit, however they run pretty large ! I'm typically a Men's US 10, even in Adidas, but with these shoes I can safely say I'm an 8 . 5 .

For one I quite enjoy the color of them, the blue is a lovely aqua, not too green nor too electric blue .

These boots are gorgeous, but I ordered a medium and realized how ridiculously narrow these are (can't even wear them with socks) . Tried to exchange them for a wide pair (same size), was told they are NOT making them in wide anymore . What the heck ? Why would you NOT make them in wide ? And if so, add it in the description to save people time, money, and a headache !####[['boots', 'appearance general', 'positive', 'are', 'direct'], ['boots', 'appearance form', 'negative', 'i', 'direct'], ['pair', 'contextofuse purchase_context', 'negative', 'tried', 'direct'], ['pair', 'performance sizing_fit', 'negative', 'not', 'direct'], ['implicit', 'performance sizing_fit', 'negative', 'why', 'direct'], ['implicit', 'cost_value', 'negative', 'why', 'direct'], ['implicit', 'contextofuse purchase_context', 'negative', 'if', 'direct']]

I really love these boots - they fit well, they keep me warm (even up in Northern Minnesota ! ), and they're super cute . The only issue is that for the first week or so they gave me absolutely horrific blisters, and they still sometimes rub a little .

Shoes arrived in poor condition with scuffs and the leather puckered at certain area, and the tissue wrapping was in disarrayed . The employees didn't take the time to look inside the box before shipping .

I am seriously bummed out that you no longer sell this shoe in leather . I have been wearing it and loving it for over 20 years, thus purchasing a LOT of shoes from your company .

I happily wore the Princess (called the Diana long ago) for many years . They are now drastically downgraded, with imitation leather, no arch support, and unreliable fit .
