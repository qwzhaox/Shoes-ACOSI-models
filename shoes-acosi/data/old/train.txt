I love the way the shoes look and they feel great on the bottom of my feet however they are really narrow and not very comfortable around the middle/ upper part of my feet .

There were a Christmas gift to someone . She LOVES the color (Red) . Says they fit very nicely . She's on her feet for long stretches for work .

These are definitely going to be some of my most worn shoes of the spring and summer . They're so cute and go with so much .

As someone with a kind of wide foot, I really wanted this shoe to fit because I love the look ! Reebok is a go-to brand for me because their shoes often fit my wide feet well in a way other brands don't .

The shoe fit well and was sturdily constructed . It comes with 2 pairs of laces; black and white . That's a nice touch for changing up the look . The insole, however, is sort of cloth-covered .

It's a great fitting and comfortable shoe and looks great .

This shoe was supposed to be x-wide but it isn't nearly as wide as the other x-wide I bought at the same time (or last year) . Ridiculous .

The shoe itself might be one of those most comfortable shoes I have ever worn, but as with such the low rating the color did not match what I received .

I purchased the outer space color and it's actually much more navy blue than the dark gray I thought it would be .

I was excited to order a pair of these classic shoes, because I had a pair many years ago when they were originally introduced . I was dismayed to try on a size 13 and feel how shallow the toe box is on the new versions . I then ordered a 14 and it just felt too big all around the sides .

I have been buying New Balance shoes for years mostly due to their great ratings for stability and cushioning plantar fasciitis . I was so disappointed in these .

These are true to fit, attractve, but quality is lacking . I bought these to replace leather NIKE sneakers to wear while working out on the treadmill .

I have noticed that the quality of the New Balance products is slipping over the years and I think this has to do with the constant 'out-sourcing' to foreign countries for production .

I'm truly satisfied with this purchase ! Ordered a size 7 but it was too small, so i ended up getting a 7 . 5 still a little snug but better . The exchange process was very easy .

This shoes looks cute and fashionable . But if u look through the inside under your insole you can see the way they needle, its not too perfect . And this is the only thing that i dont like .

I saw a targeted ad for these, the photo made them look really bright . But they're actually really muted . You can't even tell they're superstars .

I purchased 2 different pairs of DNA 5 . 0 and both of them the right shoe, the sole/support of the shoe is slightly bigger than the left shoe .

It is narrow and fits pretty well . However, the tread design traps mud and other debris which I then track into the house .

I loved your product number 1340 v2 N2 and I still walk regularly with the few pairs I have left . For some reason the newer models do not feel the same to me . So, bottom line I'm bummed .

If you're looking for a comfortable and stable running shoe that is durable, you have come to the right place . Super cushioned, breathable upper, great fit that is true to size .

These are so comfortable and cute . But I ordered a half size larger than my normal 7 1/2, and they are still so short . I don't even know if an 8 and 1/2 would even work .

I purchased this product to replace an old pair of sneakers .

It's not the most comfortable shoes I've had from Adidas, my feet were starting to get sore after standing for a long time . Also, the soles must have been made in different factories or something because the soles sizes were different .

Excited to see a New Balance shoe with a Vibram sole . The shoes appeared to be well designed and constructed . I tried to different sizes to get a good fit .

I play once a week in an inside court and after using these shoes for only three months, the whole front side of the shoes' seems completely tore apart .

Shoes very cool . Leather of most of the shoe is soft which is nice, however the dye comes off with any type of cleaning resulting in sploshes and the shoe looking a slight shade of blue/gray .

Order a half size smaller . Like any leather shoes, they take awhile to break in . Especially if you are skating them .

Use for running . First time buying 940 series . Have used 880 series for a good while but comments on current 880v10 regarding changes to toe box coupled with my dislike of 'fresh foam' feel prompted me to try 940 .

The shoe was nice but they were dirty like they were worn before and had scuffs on the side and front and there was glue on the front .
