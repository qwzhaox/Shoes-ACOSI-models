Four months ago, I replaced my previous set of tennis shoes (same shoe) that previously lasted more than a year with a new pair, purchased at the local New Balance Store . This is the 3rd or 4th pair of NBs .####[['tennis', 'Performance#Durability', 'Positive', 'I', 'indirect']]

I do a lot of walking . In the past I have always worn the 577 model, size 10, but those were not available .

My previous shies were New Balance so I was excited to try these and was unhappy with the result . Returned immediately .####[['IMPLICIT', 'ContextOfUse#Use case', 'Neutral', 'I', 'direct'], ['IMPLICIT', 'Performance#Support/Stability', 'Negative', 'disappointed', 'direct'], ['sole', 'Appearance#Shoe Component', 'Negative', 'was', 'direct'], ['New', 'General', 'Negative', 'I', 'indirect'], ['IMPLICIT', 'Cost/Value', 'Negative', 'Returned', 'direct']]
These were kinda disappointing, I've been a runner for 11 years and I've gone through many shoes . I wasn't impressed with any aspect of these shoes . The foam in them is hard/thin, the shoe itself just looks cheaply made . The grip on the bottom isn't there . I was looking for a light weight, cushioned and nice runners tread . If you are looking for a reliable running shoe keep looking !####[['shoes', 'Performance#Use Case Applicability', 'Negative', 'kinda', 'direct'], ['shoes', 'General', 'Negative', "wasn't", 'direct'], ['foam', 'Appearance#Material', 'Negative', 'in', 'direct'], ['shoe', 'Appearance#Misc', 'Negative', 'itself', 'direct'], ['grip', 'Appearance#Shoe Component', 'Negative', 'The', 'direct'], ['IMPLICIT', 'Performance#Support/Stability', 'Negative', 'The', 'direct'], ['IMPLICIT', 'ContextOfUse#Purchase\\_Context', 'Neutral', 'I', 'direct'], ['shoe', 'Performance#General', 'Negative', 'If', 'direct']]

These run way too small, asked for return label, shipped back 1-5-21 . Tracking shows returned item sitting 20 miles from the return destination for 10 days . They aresupposedly lost .

Love Fresh Foam but not these . Don't like the band across the instep .

This shoe is extremely light weight and comfortable ! Great for everyday use as well as working out . The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because they run a little big .####[['shoe', 'Appearance#Material', 'Positive', 'is', 'direct'], ['shoe', 'Performance#Comfort', 'Positive', 'comfortable', 'direct'], ['IMPLICIT', 'Performance#Use Case Applicability', 'Positive', 'Great', 'direct'], ['IMPLICIT', 'Performance#Sizing/Fit', 'Negative', 'only', 'direct']]

I normally wear an 8 . 5, but i had to get a 9 . I still don't think it fits my foot well and i do have a narrow foot . It could just be my feet . Oh well . Excellent shoe otherwise !
