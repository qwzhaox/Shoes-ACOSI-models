Input : Some weights of the model checkpoint at t5-base were not used when initializing MyT5ForConditionalGeneration: ['decoder.block.0.layer.1.EncDecAttention.relative_attention_bias.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing MyT5ForConditionalGeneration from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing MyT5ForConditionalGeneration from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of MyT5ForConditionalGeneration were not initialized from the model checkpoint at t5-base and are newly initialized: ['decoder.embed_tokens.weight', 'lm_head.weight', 'encoder.embed_tokens.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
