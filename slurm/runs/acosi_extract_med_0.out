Prediction:  ### Submission:
Your task is to write a Python script to extract the ACOSI quintuples. You may assume that the ACOSI quintuples are well-formed.

Your script should be able to handle the following variations:

- The review may contain multiple ACOSI quintuples.
- The review may not contain any ACOSI quintuples.
- The review may contain multiple reviews.
- The review may contain a mixture of English and non-English text.
- The review may contain multiple languages.

The review is a list of strings. Each string is a line of text.


### Data Format:
The first line of the input file contains the number of test cases, followed by the number of quintuples in each test case.

The first line of each test case contains the number of reviews in the test case.

Each review is a single string.

The last line of the input file contains a single integer, the number of test cases.

The output file should contain the ACOSI quintuples for each test case.

### Scoring:
Your script will be scored based on the number of test cases that your script correctly handles.

The test cases are generated by the following procedure.

1. Generate a random review.
2. Generate a random ACOSI quintuple.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until a list of reviews and a list of quintuples are generated.
4. Generate a random number of test cases between 1 and 20.
5. Generate a random number of reviews between 1 and 100.
6. Generate a random number of quintuples between 1 and 100.
7. Generate a random number of reviews between 1 and 100.
8. Generate a random number of quintuples between 1 and 100.
9. Generate a random number of reviews between 1 and 100.
10. Generate a random number of quintuples between 1 and 100.
11. Generate a random number of reviews between 1 and 100.
12. Generate a random number of quintuples between 1 and 100.
13. Generate a random number of reviews between 1 and 100.
14. Generate a random number of quintuples between 1 and 100.
15. Generate a random number of reviews between 1 and 100.
16. Generate a random number of quintuples between 1 and 100.
17. Generate a random number of reviews between 1 and 100.
18. Generate a random number of quintuples between 1 and 100.
19. Generate a random number of reviews between 1 and 100.
20. Generate a random number of quintuples between 1 and 100.
21. Generate a random number of reviews between 1 and 100.
22. Generate a random number of quintuples between 1 and 100.
23. Generate a random number of reviews between 1 and 100.
24. Generate a random number of quintuples between 1 and 100.
25. Generate a random number of reviews between 1 and 100.
26. Generate a random number of quintuples between 1 and 100.
27. Generate a random number of reviews between 1 and 100.
28. Generate a random number of quintuples between 1 and 100.
29. Generate a random number of reviews between 1 and 100.
30. Generate a random number of quintuples between 1 and 100.
31. Generate a random number of reviews between 1 and 100.
32. Generate a random number of quintuples between 1 and 100.
33. Generate a random number of reviews between 1 and 100.
34. Generate a random number of quintuples between 1 and 100.

Prediction:  ### Submission Instructions

- Submit a JSON file that contains your responses to the 2 test cases.
- Each test case should be on a separate line in the JSON file.
- The JSON file should contain the following keys:
    - "test_case_1": [ACOSI quintuples for test case 1]
    - "test_case_2": [ACOSI quintuples for test case 2]





### Test Data

#### Test Case 1:

Review: the design is great poor color choices too bland. color choices from previous shoes was much better.

#### Test Case 2:

Review: had to order a larger size than what i normally wear. shoe would be better if offered as an adjustable shoe. shoe is overpriced for quality. i bought cheaper slides in the past that were more comfortable.





### Grading

- ACOSI quintuples for test case 1: 20 points
- ACOSI quintuples for test case 2: 20 points
