### Instruction:
An online customer review can be organized into a list of ACOS (Aspect-Category-Opinion-Sentiment) quadruples.
    
Each quadruple is comprised of 4 components:
- Aspect [A]: The span of text in the review that indicates the particular aspect that the customer is referring to. Aspects are not always explicitly stated; if this is the case, the aspect is labeled NULL.
- Category [C]: The category of the aspect, selected from a predetermined list.
- Sentiment [S]: The polarity of the sentiment: positive, negative, or neutral.
- Opinion [O]: The span of text in the review that indicates the opinion that expresses the sentiment. Opinions are not always explicitly stated; if this is the case, the opinion is labeled NULL.

Given an online customer review and its corresponding ACOS (Aspect-Category-Opinion-Sentiment) quadruples, identify each opinion span. For implicit opinions (labeled NULL), identify the span of text that best expresses the sentiment implicitly.
[END] is used to mark the end of the set of quadruples associated with a review and [SSEP] is used to separate individual quadruples in the set.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
An online customer review can be organized into a list of ACOS (Aspect-Category-Opinion-Sentiment) quadruples.
    
Each quadruple is comprised of 4 components:
- Aspect [A]: The span of text in the review that indicates the particular aspect that the customer is referring to. Aspects are not always explicitly stated; if this is the case, the aspect is labeled NULL.
- Category [C]: The category of the aspect, selected from a predetermined list.
- Sentiment [S]: The polarity of the sentiment: positive, negative, or neutral.
- Opinion [O]: The span of text in the review that indicates the opinion that expresses the sentiment. Opinions are not always explicitly stated; if this is the case, the opinion is labeled NULL.

Given an online customer review and its corresponding ACOS (Aspect-Category-Opinion-Sentiment) quadruples, identify each opinion span. For implicit opinions (labeled NULL), identify the span of text that best expresses the sentiment implicitly.
[END] is used to mark the end of the set of quadruples associated with a review and [SSEP] is used to separate individual quadruples in the set.

### Instruction:
An online customer review can be organized into a list of ACOS (Aspect-Category-Opinion-Sentiment) quadruples.
    
Each quadruple is comprised of 4 components:
- Aspect [A]: The span of text in the review that indicates the particular aspect that the customer is referring to. Aspects are not always explicitly stated; if this is the case, the aspect is labeled NULL.
- Category [C]: The category of the aspect, selected from a predetermined list.
- Sentiment [S]: The polarity of the sentiment: positive, negative, or neutral.
- Opinion [O]: The span of text in the review that indicates the opinion that expresses the sentiment. Opinions are not always explicitly stated; if this is the case, the opinion is labeled NULL.

Given an online customer review and its corresponding ACOS (Aspect-Category-Opinion-Sentiment) quadruples, identify each opinion span. For implicit opinions (labeled NULL), identify the span of text that best expresses the sentiment implicitly.
[END] is used to mark the end of the set of quadruples associated with a review and [SSEP] is used to separate individual quadruples in the set.

### Instruction:
An online customer review can be organized into a list of ACOS (Aspect-Category-Opinion-Sentiment) quadruples.
    
Each quadruple is comprised of 4 components:
- Aspect [A]: The span of text in the review that indicates the particular aspect that the customer is referring to. Aspects are not always explicitly stated; if this is the case, the aspect is labeled NULL.
- Category [C]: The category of the aspect, selected from a predetermined list.
- Sentiment [S]: The polarity of the sentiment: positive, negative, or neutral.
- Opinion [O]: The span of text in the review that indicates the opinion that expresses the sentiment. Opinions are not always explicitly stated; if this is the case, the opinion is labeled NULL.

Given an online customer review and its corresponding ACOS (Aspect-Category-Opinion-Sentiment) quadruples, identify each opinion span. For implicit opinions (labeled NULL), identify the span of text that best expresses the sentiment implicitly.
[END] is used to mark the end of the set of quadruples associated with a review and [SSEP] is used to separate individual quadruples in the set.

An online customer review can be organized into a list of ACOS (Aspect-Category-Opinion-Sentiment) quadruples.
    
Each quadruple is comprised of 4 components:
- Aspect [A]: The span of text in the review that indicates the particular aspect that the customer is referring to. Aspects are not always explicitly stated; if this is the case, the aspect is labeled NULL.
- Category [C]: The category of the aspect, selected from a predetermined list.
- Sentiment [S]: The polarity of the sentiment: positive, negative, or neutral.
- Opinion [O]: The span of text in the review that indicates the opinion that expresses the sentiment. Opinions are not always explicitly stated; if this is the case, the opinion is labeled NULL.

Given an online customer review and its corresponding ACOS (Aspect-Category-Opinion-Sentiment) quadruples, identify each opinion span. For implicit opinions (labeled NULL), identify the span of text that best expresses the sentiment implicitly.
[END] is used to mark the end of the set of quadruples associated with a review and [SSEP] is used to separate individual quadruples in the set.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
An online customer review can be organized into a list of ACOS (Aspect-Category-Opinion-Sentiment) quadruples.
    
Each quadruple is comprised of 4 components:
- Aspect [A]: The span of text in the review that indicates the particular aspect that the customer is referring to. Aspects are not always explicitly stated; if this is the case, the aspect is labeled NULL.
- Category [C]: The category of the aspect, selected from a predetermined list.
- Sentiment [S]: The polarity of the sentiment: positive, negative, or neutral.
- Opinion [O]: The span of text in the review that indicates the opinion that expresses the sentiment. Opinions are not always explicitly stated; if this is the case, the opinion is labeled NULL.

Given an online customer review and its corresponding ACOS (Aspect-Category-Opinion-Sentiment) quadruples, identify each opinion span. For implicit opinions (labeled NULL), identify the span of text that best expresses the sentiment implicitly.
[END] is used to mark the end of the set of quadruples associated with a review and [SSEP] is used to separate individual quadruples in the set.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
An online customer review can be organized into a list of ACOS (Aspect-Category-Opinion-Sentiment) quadruples.
    
Each quadruple is comprised of 4 components:
- Aspect [A]: The span of text in the review that indicates the particular aspect that the customer is referring to. Aspects are not always explicitly stated; if this is the case, the aspect is labeled NULL.
- Category [C]: The category of the aspect, selected from a predetermined list.
- Sentiment [S]: The polarity of the sentiment: positive, negative, or neutral.
- Opinion [O]: The span of text in the review that indicates the opinion that expresses the sentiment. Opinions are not always explicitly stated; if this is the case, the opinion is labeled NULL.

Given an online customer review and its corresponding ACOS (Aspect-Category-Opinion-Sentiment) quadruples, identify each opinion span. For implicit opinions (labeled NULL), identify the span of text that best expresses the sentiment implicitly.
[END] is used to mark the end of the set of quadruples associated with a review and [SSEP] is used to separate individual quadruples in the set.

- Category [C]: The category of the aspect, selected from a predetermined list.
- Sentiment [S]: The polarity of the sentiment: positive, negative, or neutral.
- Opinion [O]: The span of text in the review that indicates the opinion that expresses the sentiment. Opinions are not always explicitly stated; if this is the case, the opinion is labeled NULL.

Given an online customer review and its corresponding ACOS (Aspect-Category-Opinion-Sentiment) quadruples, identify each opinion span. For implicit opinions (labeled NULL), identify the span of text that best expresses the sentiment implicitly.
[END] is used to mark the end of the set of quadruples associated with a review and [SSEP] is used to separate individual quadruples in the set.

### Instruction:
An online customer review can be organized into a list of ACOS (Aspect-Category-Opinion-Sentiment) quadruples.
    
Each quadruple is comprised of 4 components:
- Aspect [A]: The span of text in the review that indicates the particular aspect that the customer is referring to. Aspects are not always explicitly stated; if this is the case, the aspect is labeled NULL.
- Category [C]: The category of the aspect, selected from a predetermined list.
- Sentiment [S]: The polarity of the sentiment: positive, negative, or neutral.
- Opinion [O]: The span of text in the review that indicates the opinion that expresses the sentiment. Opinions are not always explicitly stated; if this is the case, the opinion is labeled NULL.

Given an online customer review and its corresponding ACOS (Aspect-Category-Opinion-Sentiment) quadruples, identify each opinion span. For implicit opinions (labeled NULL), identify the span of text that best expresses the sentiment implicitly.
[END] is used to mark the end of the set of quadruples associated with a review and [SSEP] is used to separate individual quadruples in the set.

### Instruction:
An online customer review can be organized into a list of ACOS (Aspect-Category-Opinion-Sentiment) quadruples.
    
Each quadruple is comprised of 4 components:
- Aspect [A]: The span of text in the review that indicates the particular aspect that the customer is referring to. Aspects are not always explicitly stated; if this is the case, the aspect is labeled NULL.
- Category [C]: The category of the aspect, selected from a predetermined list.
- Sentiment [S]: The polarity of the sentiment: positive, negative, or neutral.
- Opinion [O]: The span of text in the review that indicates the opinion that expresses the sentiment. Opinions are not always explicitly stated; if this is the case, the opinion is labeled NULL.

Given an online customer review and its corresponding ACOS (Aspect-Category-Opinion-Sentiment) quadruples, identify each opinion span. For implicit opinions (labeled NULL), identify the span of text that best expresses the sentiment implicitly.
[END] is used to mark the end of the set of quadruples associated with a review and [SSEP] is used to separate individual quadruples in the set.

### Instruction:
An online customer review can be organized into a list of ACOS (Aspect-Category-Opinion-Sentiment) quadruples.
    
Each quadruple is comprised of 4 components:
- Aspect [A]: The span of text in the review that indicates the particular aspect that the customer is referring to. Aspects are not always explicitly stated; if this is the case, the aspect is labeled NULL.
- Category [C]: The category of the aspect, selected from a predetermined list.
- Sentiment [S]: The polarity of the sentiment: positive, negative, or neutral.
- Opinion [O]: The span of text in the review that indicates the opinion that expresses the sentiment. Opinions are not always explicitly stated; if this is the case, the opinion is labeled NULL.

Given an online customer review and its corresponding ACOS (Aspect-Category-Opinion-Sentiment) quadruples, identify each opinion span. For implicit opinions (labeled NULL), identify the span of text that best expresses the sentiment implicitly.
[END] is used to mark the end of the set of quadruples associated with a review and [SSEP] is used to separate individual quadruples in the set.

### Instruction:
An online customer review can be organized into a list of ACOS (Aspect-Category-Opinion-Sentiment) quadruples.
    
Each quadruple is comprised of 4 components:
- Aspect [A]: The span of text in the review that indicates the particular aspect that the customer is referring to. Aspects are not always explicitly stated; if this is the case, the aspect is labeled NULL.
- Category [C]: The category of the aspect, selected from a predetermined list.
- Sentiment [S]: The polarity of the sentiment: positive, negative, or neutral.
- Opinion [O]: The span of text in the review that indicates the opinion that expresses the sentiment. Opinions are not always explicitly stated; if this is the case, the opinion is labeled NULL.

Given an online customer review and its corresponding ACOS (Aspect-Category-Opinion-Sentiment) quadruples, identify each opinion span. For implicit opinions (labeled NULL), identify the span of text that best expresses the sentiment implicitly.
[END] is used to mark the end of the set of quadruples associated with a review and [SSEP] is used to separate individual quadruples in the set.

### Instruction:
An online customer review can be organized into a list of ACOS (Aspect-Category-Opinion-Sentiment) quadruples.
    
Each quadruple is comprised of 4 components:
- Aspect [A]: The span of text in the review that indicates the particular aspect that the customer is referring to. Aspects are not always explicitly stated; if this is the case, the aspect is labeled NULL.
- Category [C]: The category of the aspect, selected from a predetermined list.
- Sentiment [S]: The polarity of the sentiment: positive, negative, or neutral.
- Opinion [O]: The span of text in the review that indicates the opinion that expresses the sentiment. Opinions are not always explicitly stated; if this is the case, the opinion is labeled NULL.

Given an online customer review and its corresponding ACOS (Aspect-Category-Opinion-Sentiment) quadruples, identify each opinion span. For implicit opinions (labeled NULL), identify the span of text that best expresses the sentiment implicitly.
[END] is used to mark the end of the set of quadruples associated with a review and [SSEP] is used to separate individual quadruples in the set.

### Instruction:
An online customer review can be organized into a list of ACOS (Aspect-Category-Opinion-Sentiment) quadruples.
    
Each quadruple is comprised of 4 components:
- Aspect [A]: The span of text in the review that indicates the particular aspect that the customer is referring to. Aspects are not always explicitly stated; if this is the case, the aspect is labeled NULL.
- Category [C]: The category of the aspect, selected from a predetermined list.
- Sentiment [S]: The polarity of the sentiment: positive, negative, or neutral.
- Opinion [O]: The span of text in the review that indicates the opinion that expresses the sentiment. Opinions are not always explicitly stated; if this is the case, the opinion is labeled NULL.

Given an online customer review and its corresponding ACOS (Aspect-Category-Opinion-Sentiment) quadruples, identify each opinion span. For implicit opinions (labeled NULL), identify the span of text that best expresses the sentiment implicitly.
[END] is used to mark the end of the set of quadruples associated with a review and [SSEP] is used to separate individual quadruples in the set.

### Instruction:
An online customer review can be organized into a list of ACOS (Aspect-Category-Opinion-Sentiment) quadruples.
    
Each quadruple is comprised of 4 components:
- Aspect [A]: The span of text in the review that indicates the particular aspect that the customer is referring to. Aspects are not always explicitly stated; if this is the case, the aspect is labeled NULL.
- Category [C]: The category of the aspect, selected from a predetermined list.
- Sentiment [S]: The polarity of the sentiment: positive, negative, or neutral.
- Opinion [O]: The span of text in the review that indicates the opinion that expresses the sentiment. Opinions are not always explicitly stated; if this is the case, the opinion is labeled NULL.

Given an online customer review and its corresponding ACOS (Aspect-Category-Opinion-Sentiment) quadruples, identify each opinion span. For implicit opinions (labeled NULL), identify the span of text that best expresses the sentiment implicitly.
[END] is used to mark the end of the set of quadruples associated with a review and [SSEP] is used to separate individual quadruples in the set.

- Category [C]: The category of the aspect, selected from a predetermined list.
- Sentiment [S]: The polarity of the sentiment: positive, negative, or neutral.
- Opinion [O]: The span of text in the review that indicates the opinion that expresses the sentiment. Opinions are not always explicitly stated; if this is the case, the opinion is labeled NULL.

Given an online customer review and its corresponding ACOS (Aspect-Category-Opinion-Sentiment) quadruples, identify each opinion span. For implicit opinions (labeled NULL), identify the span of text that best expresses the sentiment implicitly.
[END] is used to mark the end of the set of quadruples associated with a review and [SSEP] is used to separate individual quadruples in the set.

### Instruction:
An online customer review can be organized into a list of ACOS (Aspect-Category-Opinion-Sentiment) quadruples.
    
Each quadruple is comprised of 4 components:
- Aspect [A]: The span of text in the review that indicates the particular aspect that the customer is referring to. Aspects are not always explicitly stated; if this is the case, the aspect is labeled NULL.
- Category [C]: The category of the aspect, selected from a predetermined list.
- Sentiment [S]: The polarity of the sentiment: positive, negative, or neutral.
- Opinion [O]: The span of text in the review that indicates the opinion that expresses the sentiment. Opinions are not always explicitly stated; if this is the case, the opinion is labeled NULL.

Given an online customer review and its corresponding ACOS (Aspect-Category-Opinion-Sentiment) quadruples, identify each opinion span. For implicit opinions (labeled NULL), identify the span of text that best expresses the sentiment implicitly.
[END] is used to mark the end of the set of quadruples associated with a review and [SSEP] is used to separate individual quadruples in the set.

- Category [C]: The category of the aspect, selected from a predetermined list.
- Sentiment [S]: The polarity of the sentiment: positive, negative, or neutral.
- Opinion [O]: The span of text in the review that indicates the opinion that expresses the sentiment. Opinions are not always explicitly stated; if this is the case, the opinion is labeled NULL.

Given an online customer review and its corresponding ACOS (Aspect-Category-Opinion-Sentiment) quadruples, identify each opinion span. For implicit opinions (labeled NULL), identify the span of text that best expresses the sentiment implicitly.
[END] is used to mark the end of the set of quadruples associated with a review and [SSEP] is used to separate individual quadruples in the set.

- Aspect [A]: The span of text in the review that indicates the particular aspect that the customer is referring to. Aspects are not always explicitly stated; if this is the case, the aspect is labeled NULL.
- Category [C]: The category of the aspect, selected from a predetermined list.
- Sentiment [S]: The polarity of the sentiment: positive, negative, or neutral.
- Opinion [O]: The span of text in the review that indicates the opinion that expresses the sentiment. Opinions are not always explicitly stated; if this is the case, the opinion is labeled NULL.

Given an online customer review and its corresponding ACOS (Aspect-Category-Opinion-Sentiment) quadruples, identify each opinion span. For implicit opinions (labeled NULL), identify the span of text that best expresses the sentiment implicitly.
[END] is used to mark the end of the set of quadruples associated with a review and [SSEP] is used to separate individual quadruples in the set.

An online customer review can be organized into a list of ACOS (Aspect-Category-Opinion-Sentiment) quadruples.
    
Each quadruple is comprised of 4 components:
- Aspect [A]: The span of text in the review that indicates the particular aspect that the customer is referring to. Aspects are not always explicitly stated; if this is the case, the aspect is labeled NULL.
- Category [C]: The category of the aspect, selected from a predetermined list.
- Sentiment [S]: The polarity of the sentiment: positive, negative, or neutral.
- Opinion [O]: The span of text in the review that indicates the opinion that expresses the sentiment. Opinions are not always explicitly stated; if this is the case, the opinion is labeled NULL.

Given an online customer review and its corresponding ACOS (Aspect-Category-Opinion-Sentiment) quadruples, identify each opinion span. For implicit opinions (labeled NULL), identify the span of text that best expresses the sentiment implicitly.
[END] is used to mark the end of the set of quadruples associated with a review and [SSEP] is used to separate individual quadruples in the set.

Review: if you have even the slightest bit of width to your foot , do not buy these . i would consider my foot slightly wide , often not even having to buy the wide version of shoes . however , the balls of my feet completely bulged out of the side of the sole on these shoes . these are the most narrow shoes i have ever tried on in my life . also , your " print label " button on your return site doesn ' t work .

An online customer review can be organized into a list of ACOS (Aspect-Category-Opinion-Sentiment) quadruples.
    
Each quadruple is comprised of 4 components:
- Aspect [A]: The span of text in the review that indicates the particular aspect that the customer is referring to. Aspects are not always explicitly stated; if this is the case, the aspect is labeled NULL.
- Category [C]: The category of the aspect, selected from a predetermined list.
- Sentiment [S]: The polarity of the sentiment: positive, negative, or neutral.
- Opinion [O]: The span of text in the review that indicates the opinion that expresses the sentiment. Opinions are not always explicitly stated; if this is the case, the opinion is labeled NULL.

Given an online customer review and its corresponding ACOS (Aspect-Category-Opinion-Sentiment) quadruples, identify each opinion span. For implicit opinions (labeled NULL), identify the span of text that best expresses the sentiment implicitly.
[END] is used to mark the end of the set of quadruples associated with a review and [SSEP] is used to separate individual quadruples in the set.

Review: the color on the site has neutral beige / brown tones , unfortunately , in person the color is all gray . don ' t buy if you ' re expecting anything other than bland gray . will be returning immediately .

### Response:
Opinion spans: [O] design is great [SSEP] [O] poor color choices [SSEP] [O] color choices from previous shoes was much better [END]

The opinion span for the first quadruple is "design is great", the opinion span for the second quadruple is "poor color choices", and the implicit opinion span for the third quadruple (originally labeled NULL) is "color choices from previous shoes was much better".
