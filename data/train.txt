I love the way the shoes look and they feel great on the bottom of my feet however they are really narrow and not very comfortable around the middle/ upper part of my feet .

These are definitely going to be some of my most worn shoes of the spring and summer . They're so cute and go with so much .

As someone with a kind of wide foot, I really wanted this shoe to fit because I love the look ! Reebok is a go-to brand for me because their shoes often fit my wide feet well in a way other brands don't .

The shoe fit well and was sturdily constructed . It comes with 2 pairs of laces; black and white . That's a nice touch for changing up the look . The insole, however, is sort of cloth-covered .

My ankles tend toward supination, so a well-cushioned heel is crucial . Every other pair of NBs I own give great even support, but the outer heels on this pair collapsed after less than a week !

I originally thought that the first time I wore these sneakers and got a blister it was because they were new, but I never encountered this problem before .

It's a great fitting and comfortable shoe and looks great .

These shoes look super cool and they have foam inside to cushion your ankle .

I bought these shoes for my husband who has foot drop due to spinal injury and needs an especially supportive shoe . This shoe didn't do the job .

This shoe was supposed to be x-wide but it isn't nearly as wide as the other x-wide I bought at the same time (or last year) . Ridiculous .

New Balance changed the tongue of the shoe and it is now thinner than previous versions . I imagine this is a cost-saving move, because why change something that isn't broke ?

The shoe itself might be one of those most comfortable shoes I have ever worn, but as with such the low rating the color did not match what I received .

I was excited to order a pair of these classic shoes, because I had a pair many years ago when they were originally introduced . I was dismayed to try on a size 13 and feel how shallow the toe box is on the new versions . I then ordered a 14 and it just felt too big all around the sides .

I have been buying New Balance shoes for years mostly due to their great ratings for stability and cushioning plantar fasciitis . I was so disappointed in these .

These are true to fit, attractve, but quality is lacking . I bought these to replace leather NIKE sneakers to wear while working out on the treadmill .

I have noticed that the quality of the New Balance products is slipping over the years and I think this has to do with the constant 'out-sourcing' to foreign countries for production .

Usually I'm very happy with my Brooks but these have given me blisters and hurt the top of my left foot no matter what I try .

First time buying Brooks . I was hesitant because I am not really an avid runner . Thiis shoe more than meets my needs for running and at the same time it looks good too .

I wanted these to wear around as a quick slip on shoe . They are really wide and slightly Short . They also make a creaking sound when I walk like cheap shoes would .

These are so comfortable and cute . But I ordered a half size larger than my normal 7 1/2, and they are still so short . I don't even know if an 8 and 1/2 would even work .

I purchased this product to replace an old pair of sneakers . The tongue of the shoe is inflexible ( doesn't bend or flap back) and attached to the side of the shoe making it very difficult to put on . You have to 'slip' this sneaker on your foot - ugh !

It's not the most comfortable shoes I've had from Adidas, my feet were starting to get sore after standing for a long time . Also, the soles must have been made in different factories or something because the soles sizes were different .

Poorly made and wish I saw it before I wore it .####[['not', 'performance comfort', 'negative', 'shoes', 'direct'], ['shoes', 'performance comfort', 'negative', 'not', 'direct'], ['shoes', 'performance comfort', 'negative', 'my', 'indirect'], ['shoes', 'contextofuse usage frequency', 'negative', 'after', 'indirect'], ['soles', 'performance sizing_fit', 'negative', 'the', 'direct'], ['right', 'appearance shoe component', 'negative', 'stuck', 'direct'], ['right', 'performance sizing_fit', 'negative', 'at', 'direct'], ['implicit', 'appearance misc', 'negative', 'poorly', 'direct']]

These boots are perfect for everyday use . I wanted something suitable for a lot of hiking/biking/walking, and also grubbing around on video shoots .

I have very narrow heels and extra wide toes . The medium width is pretty true to size . However, a more rounded toe would be more comfortable for my oddly shaped feet .

I absolutely love these boots ! Especially the black, they are perfect for walking around the city and going out in when the weather is really cold .

These boots are great, they don't get dirty easily and they are easy to clean when they do . Also, they make even sweatpants look more put together with a specific look .

Shoes very cool . Leather of most of the shoe is soft which is nice, however the dye comes off with any type of cleaning resulting in sploshes and the shoe looking a slight shade of blue/gray .

I love my Presto . It is so light lang very nice for casual wear . They didn't hurt my feet at all . I wore them all day to test it and happy with the result :):) The only minus for me is they don't have half size . Since it's not a mesh-like material it's kinda tight since I have wide feet :) So i wear them with footsock instead of 'real' socks .####[['presto', 'general', 'positive', 'i', 'direct'], ['implicit', 'contextofuse use case', 'positive', 'so', 'direct'], ['implicit', 'performance comfort', 'positive', "didn't", 'indirect'], ['implicit', 'contextofuse usage frequency', 'positive', 'i', 'direct'], ['implicit', 'performance sizing_fit', 'negative', 'the', 'direct'], ['mesh-like', 'appearance material', 'negative', 'not', 'direct'], ['implicit', 'performance sizing_fit', 'negative', 'kinda', 'direct'], ['implicit', 'performance sizing_fit', 'negative', 'kinda', 'direct'], ['implicit', 'performance sizing_fit', 'negative', 'i', 'indirect']]

As you can see in the side view of this shoe, the toes end is lifted off the ground . This is very noticeable when you walk in these shoes .

Liked the shoes . I left them outside and the next day they had shrunk by about 3 full sizes . I assume it was from the heat from the sun .

I have several pairs of NewBalance shoes which all fit well and are very comfortable .

It took 7 days for it to finally ship . I requested updates at 3 and then 7 days and got no responses, other than, I think it will ship out today on day 3 .

We've owned 10+ pairs of nb freeze cleats and these by far are the least durable . Normally we get 6-9 months and grow out of the cleats before they wear out .

Use for running . First time buying 940 series .

Loved the shoe but it just wasn't for me . Had to send it back because it was too rigid and narrow for me . I need a flexible shoe otherwise my feet hurt .####[['shoe', 'general', 'positive', 'loved', 'direct'], ['shoe', 'contextofuse use case', 'negative', 'but', 'direct'], ['implicit', 'contextofuse purchase_context', 'negative', 'had', 'direct'], ['implicit', 'performance comfort', 'negative', 'too', 'direct'], ['implicit', 'performance comfort', 'negative', 'i', 'indirect']]
Great shoe but the sizing was a little off . Need about a half size bigger . Hard to give an honest assessment on an item that doesn't fit perfectly . Shoe no longer available so I cannot exchange for bigger size .####[['shoe', 'general', 'positive', 'great', 'direct'], ['shoe', 'performance sizing_fit', 'negative', 'but', 'indirect'], ['implicit', 'performance sizing_fit', 'neutral', 'need', 'direct'], ['hard', 'cost_value', 'neutral', 'item', 'indirect'], ['item', 'cost_value', 'neutral', 'hard', 'direct'], ['shoe', 'contextofuse purchase_context', 'negative', 'no', 'indirect']]
Warning these are not understated shoes . They are shiny white patent leather and hideous in my opinion .

I would have given sneaker a 5 out of 5 if the shoe laces were longer .

Why did they put a tag on top of the insole ! ? Every step you're reminded of the tag . No it's not something stuck in your shoe, it's a stupid tag .

I'm really enjoying this shoe . They fit SNUG . I think it's just a matter of breaking them in some .

I have been pleased with prior purchases and have owned 15 pairs of various styles of new balance shoes . I am replacing the identical shoe that was purchased in January of this year and developed a tear at a sewn seam .

Nice looking shoes . But they run small and after a couple of hours wearing them they hurt his toes .

I am not of fan white shoes but these really caught my eyes . I am most likely going to save these for summer 2021 since I feel like it's more of a summer shoe . I already know I'll be rocking these with light blue or black Levis .####[['implicit', 'appearance color', 'positive', 'i', 'indirect'], ['implicit', 'contextofuse use case', 'positive', 'i', 'indirect'], ['implicit', 'appearance color', 'positive', 'i', 'direct']]

They are incredible way to hot the shoe does not breath what's so ever . I couldn't even warm up before my round in them .

I received delivery of these shoes today . When I tried them, they turned out smaller in size .

My 16 year old daughter loves her new Air Force 1 . She wears them with a variety of clothes, from athleisure to jeans and a cute top .####[['air', 'general', 'positive', 'daughter', 'direct'], ['implicit', 'contextofuse use case', 'positive', 'wears', 'direct']]
They just run a little too tight . I should have gone up a 1/2 size .####[['implicit', 'performance sizing_fit', 'negative', 'little', 'direct'], ['implicit', 'performance sizing_fit', 'negative', 'i', 'indirect']]
I run distance, and I love the cushion of these shoes . There is a bounce to them . I've had them about a week, I do feel they are missing some of the arch support I typically feel in Nike shoes, but they are still supportive and comfortable .####[['shoes', 'performance use case applicability', 'positive', 'i', 'direct'], ['implicit', 'performance support_stability', 'positive', 'is', 'direct'], ['implicit', 'contextofuse review_temporality', 'neutral', "i've", 'direct'], ['implicit', 'performance support_stability', 'negative', 'i', 'direct'], ['implicit', 'performance support_stability', 'positive', 'but', 'indirect'], ['implicit', 'performance comfort', 'positive', 'comfortable', 'direct']]
They come each laced 80% with black laces then 20% green laces . Take the green laces out and finish lacing the black laces . Nice shoe .

They are super cute shoes ! Idk if i like how skinny they appear near the top though ? ? ? I think the tongue on the shoe is to short and not wide enough . . . but they are different style from my other shoes so ill wear them . . .####[['shoes', 'appearance general', 'positive', 'they', 'direct'], ['implicit', 'appearance form', 'negative', 'idk', 'indirect'], ['tongue', 'appearance shoe component', 'negative', 'think', 'direct'], ['the', 'appearance general', 'positive', 'they', 'indirect']]

These shoes are adorable ! If you have a really narrow foot, these are for you !
